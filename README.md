# Covid_Dashboard

[**Covid_Dashboard**](https://massivefile.com/Covid_Dashboard/) dynamically shows (the curvature of the graph) of Ð¡oronavirus distribution per each country.

## Reasoning

The main reason for creating a new dashboard was to complement the well-known [JHU Dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) (which is made by Johns Hopkins CSSE) with the feature of seeing the charts with the number of COVID-19 `confirmed` / `recovered`/ `deaths` use-cases per country.

### Main Functionality

Here is how the main functionality looks like:

## Technical Stack and Data source
